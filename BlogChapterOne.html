            <h3><strong>What are object and classes?</strong></h3>
            <p>Objects are entities with attributes and behaviours that describe what that object does.An object can be anything.In computers a object is conceptual,meaning that it has no physical form, its not tamgible.Objects are used to emitate real world objects to try and simulate thier behaviours , for example a book is a object. Its attributes are the number of pages it has, the name of the author, when it was created etc. Its behaviour is that it can be read and  pages can be flipped.
